## Arborescence

This folder contains the implementation of $F_\text{struct}$, $F_\text{log_prob}$ and $F_\text{cond}$ for arborescence. $F_\text{struct}$ applies the Chu-Liu Edmonds' algorithm that returns the minimal spanning arborescence of the weighted directed graph along with its execution trace. 

Chu-Liu Edmonds' algorithm is implemented in C++. To install it, go to the folder `edmonds` and run:
```
python setup.py install
```
